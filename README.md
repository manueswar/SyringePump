# SyringePump
This code was developed by me for a freelanced project for a life science research project. I would like to share the entire project to everyone who needs it.
It was build to enable highly customizable application environment; interms of controls. Unlike the usual syringe pump this was made to set custom values for Flowrate, Syringe type, Pulsed mode pumping, Continuous mode pumping.

Modes
>Pulsed mode : User can input the volume (uL) of pulse and time delay (s; m; h) between pulses
>Continuous mode : User can input the volume flow rate (uL/s)

10 types of standard syringe models (BD glass and BD plastic) were added including 1 customer model 2ml

Mechanical
As a pilot study a 3D printed model was build (FreeCAD design files and neutral 3D models avalable in 3D > PLA)
The utility prototype is all metal (AL 2000) 6mm flat bar machined model (FreeCAD design files and neutral 3D models avalable in 3D > METAL)

Enclosure for the electronics was not designed in 3D; but made with inkscape with slots for LCD, POTs, BUTTONS etc.
